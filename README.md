# Hi there! 👋

I'm Claudio Cocivera, Director of Engineering at EF, leading distributed teams across Europe, the US, and Panama.

Engineering leader by day, storyteller and stand-up comedian when given the chance - because great teams need both systems and stories.

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Champion of 'productive laziness' - if we're doing it manually more than twice, we're doing it wrong."

I believe in:
- Leading through enablement rather than direction
- Building psychologically safe environments
- Knowledge sharing and cross-functional collaboration
- Direct, honest communication
- Learning from mistakes and celebrating growth

- Driving technical excellence in Salesforce platforms
- Translating technical solutions into measurable business value
- Building resilient, cross-functional teams

## 🎨 Beyond Code

When I'm not debugging Salesforce flows, you'll find me:
- 🐕 Spending time with my pets (Susy the dog, Luna and Nettuno the cats)
- 🍕 Baking bread and pizza (and debating proper carbonara technique)
- 🎤 Performing storytelling or stand-up comedy
- 🚴 Going on long bike rides
- 🎵 Playing and listening to music
